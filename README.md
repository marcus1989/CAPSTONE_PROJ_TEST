📊 Identify regional disparities in cancer survival rates
        (1)Is there a statistically significant difference in survival outcomes based on:
            Cancer type or stage?
            Country or region?
            Gender or age group?
        (2)Does early treatment (shorter time from diagnosis to treatment) lead to improved survival outcomes?
        (3)Are patients in urban areas receiving different levels of care or experiencing different outcomes compared to rural areas?
        
📈 Analyze lifestyle factors affecting recurrence & survival
        (1)How does smoking status or alcohol consumption correlate with recurrence or survival duration?
        (2)Do comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) significantly impact survival or recurrence?

⚕️ Compare treatment efficacy across different healthcare systems


🧠 Predict patient outcomes using machine learning models
        (1)Can we predict a patient’s survival status (Alive vs Deceased) based on clinical and lifestyle factors?
        (2)How accurately can we estimate a patient’s survival duration (in months)?
        (3)Can we predict cancer recurrence after treatment using demographic and treatment features?
        (4)Can we identify patients likely to participate in clinical trials based on socioeconomic and health data?
        (5)Which features are most important in predicting quality of life after treatment?
